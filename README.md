# chemstep
Generic stepper controller for the Arduino using an LCD shield and the [Big Easy Driver](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12859) (although any stepper driver will work). Designed for use in chemical experiments where samples are moved around automagically.

Has provisions for endstops and running at different speeds. Serial interface is a work in progress.
